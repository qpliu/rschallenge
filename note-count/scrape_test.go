                              I hope I'll manage this week. On the second day of practicing (Tuesday) I developed a blister on a fingertip due to the fingerpicking, and now I dont manage to pick loud enough for the cable to pick it up. Does anyone have any advice on getting better/louder signal with fingerpicking (apart from using more force).<br /> <br /> Monday: Riff repeater. HSA fail<br /> Tuesday: Riff repeater practice, HSA fail, develop blister<br /> Wed-Friday: Try to heal the blister<br /> Sat: Practice by HSA. Manage to get through twice, once with gold and once with bronze, but forgot to screenshot the gold attempt (it anyway was with lower accuracy). Redeveloped the blister. <br /> <br /> I hope to play it again later today and tomorrow, as I know I can easily get a much better score. The problem is that with the blister I lose all feeling for the third finger, and that makes me lose a lot of notes.<br /> <br /> <br /> <img src="http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/307740101644805649/97DF04186174E37103F6813E4D40F80C41D1DB7D/" border="0" alt="" /><br /> <br /> @mangore, thanks for the tips. I actually have no problems playing fingerstyle on accoustic, although my technique is slightly different usually as I like to let the strings ring in arpeggios. Apparently one of my fingers just really doesnt like the feel of the strings I am using on the electric guitar

                              Monday: Had some strange detection problems at the end's chord parts in MSA, kept dropping some chords no matter what I did. Rather annoying as I otherwise could have FC'd the MSA. HSA seems quite daunting, are you people all fingerpicking the arpeggios or does someone use a pick there also?<br />  Div III | MSA 380,836 | 97.91% | 153 NS |<br />  <br />  <img src="http://www.zironjones.com/rs/wk123guitar.jpg" border="0" alt="" />
